    <div class="poema"> <p>Language is a Virus
        Paradise Is exactly like Where you are right now Only much much Better. I saw this guy on the train And he seemed to gave gotten stuck In one of those abstract trances. And he was going: "Ugh...Ugh...Ugh..." And Fred said: "I think he's in some kind of pain. I think it's a pain cry." And I said: "Pain cry? Then language is a virus." Language! It's a virus! Language! It's a virus! Well I was talking to a friend And I was saying: I wanted you. And I was looking for you. But I couldn't find you. I couldn't find you. And he said: Hey! Are you talking to me? Or are you just practicing For one of those performances of yours? Huh? Language! It's a virus! Language! It's a virus! He said: I had to write that letter to your mother. And I had to tell the judge that it was you. And I had to sell the car and go to Florida. Because that's just my way of saying (It's a charm.) That I love you. And I (It's a job.) Had to call you at the crack of dawn (Why?) And list the times that I've been wrong. Cause that's just my way of saying That I'm sorry. (It's a job.) Language! It's a virus! Language! It's a virus! Paradise Is exactly like Where you are right now Only much much (It's a shipwreck,) Better. (It's a job.) You know? I don't believe there's such a thing as TV. I mean - They just keep showing you The same pictures over and over. And when they talk they just make sounds That more or less synch up With their lips. That's what I think! Language! It's a virus! Language! It's a virus! Language! It's a virus! Well I dreamed there was an island That rose up from the sea. And everybody on the island Was somebody from TV. And there was a beautiful view But nobody could see. Cause everybody on the island Was saying: Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Because they all lived on an island That rose up from the sea. And everybody on the island Was somebody from TV. And there was a beautiful view But nobody could see. Cause everybody on the island Was saying: Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Why? Paradise is exactly like Where you are right now Only much much better.
